To use John the Ripper on Office 2007/2010 encrypted files, first build
the included office2john program with "make office2john" in the src/
directory.  Please note that it has extra prerequisites compared to John
itself, which is why it is not being built by default.  Thus, you will
need to install additional "development" packages first.
