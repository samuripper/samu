Other assorted changes:
* Move MYSQL_fmt_plug.c to unused/, rename MYSQL_fast_fmt_plug.c to
mysql_fmt_plug.c and change its label to just mysql (magnum)
* Several enhancements for relbench (Frank Dittrich)
* benchmark-unify: a Perl script to convert benchmark output for relbench
(Frank)
* Add three more make targets. linux-x86-clang-debug is super good for
debugging. (Dhiru)
* Move --field-separator-char and --fix-state-delay=N to hidden options (magnum)
* Add new options --loopback[=FILE] and --dupe-suppression (the former implies
the latter) and revert some stuff for backwards compatibility. (magnum)
* New (hidden) option --length=N for reducing plaintext length of a format,
mostly for testing purposes. (magnum)
* Sparc porting and other fixes (JimF)
* Fix a cosmetical off-by-one bug in wordlist.c (JimF)
* Add --list=format-details (Frank)
* Reduced binary for raw-md4, raw-md5, raw-sha1 and NT2. This decreases memory
usage with 12 bytes per loaded hash for NT/MD4/MD5 and 16 bytes for SHA1 and
should help keeping good stuff in cache. (magnum)
* Implement --markov=MODE[:<options>] and allow start and/or end to be specified
in percent (Frank)
* Add linux -native build targets (magnum)
* New option: --log-stderr (magnum)
* Loads of minor fixes for Sparc (endianness, alignment) (JimF)
* CUDA device lister, show them with --list=cuda-devices (Lukas)
* Add --list=[encodings|opencl-devices]. Deprecate --encodings=LIST (but it's
still supported). We will later support --list=cuda-devices too. Drop
--device=list and --platforms=list (not supported from now on). For the
catch-all of --list=<subsection>, add a header "Subsections of...". (magnum)
* External:Keyboard: Fixes for 8-bit characters vs signed char constants.
http://www.openwall.com/lists/john-users/2012/02/26/2 (magnum)
* Create a rule section "Extra" for the previously commented-out rules for
Single mode. Also, add new rules "Single-Extra" (consisting of Single plus
Extra) and "Jumbo" (consisting of all rules we have, including NT). I preserved
the name "All" for local use, thus using "Jumbo" instead. (magnum)
* Source $JOHN/john.local.conf by default. This file is never overwritten but
will be created empty when building, if it does not exist. It must *not* be
included in any release tarball. (magnum)
* c3_fmt.c: improve --subformat= handling (Frank)
* wordlist.c: Status bug fix (JimF)
* Add --list=subformats and deprecate --subformat=list (magnum)
* raw2dyna added. This is a helper program that converts raw hashes to dynamic
format. (JimF)
* Add new john.conf options subsection MPI and add a new config item
CrackStatus under Options:Jumbo. Note: If CrackStatus=Y in john.conf, the
--crack-status option disables it. (magnum)
* Win32 SharedMemory patch (only affects _MSC_VER, __CYGWIN32__ or __MINGW32__
builds) (JimF)
* SHA512 opencl implementation (Myrice)
* Arbitrary characters in rules, using \xnn (JimF)
* Added a new rule _N, to reject a word unless it is length N. (JimF)
* bash-completion for JtR (to install: "sudo make bash-completion") (Frank)
* New (hidden) options: --list= to be used by bash completion as well as GUI's
and other things. (magnum)
* -regenerate-lost-salts=N option, for cracking hashes where we do not have the
salt (JimF)
* Make incremental mode restore ETA figures (JimF)
* Use CommonCrypto instead of OpenSSL on OS X Lion (Dhiru)
* Enhancement of extern:double (JimF)
* Mscash and mscash2 formats prepare() fixes (JimF)
* LOTS of minor fixes for VC builds (JimF)
* Set OS_TIMER to 0 in arch.h if AMD APP SDK in installed and building OpenCL,
or if mingw is used to build 64-bit Windows build. (magnum)
* RAR format: Proper support for -p mode. OpenCL support added (in the same
one format). Added inline storing of RAR data in input file when files are
small enough. Support files larger than 2 GB. (magnum)
* New pre-built intrinsics for latest sse-intrinsics.c (magnum)
* sse-intrinsics.c: Take advantage of some SSE2 and SSSE3 intructions if
available http://www.openwall.com/lists/john-dev/2012/03/21/4 (followup) (Solar)
* Use BSD version of tcphdr (patch by Erik). (Dhiru)
* Improved vncpcap2john. Works for RFB 3.7 and 3.8 protocol versions. Works
with TightVNC and RealVNC servers. 3.3 RFB support is TODO. (Dhiru)
* sse-intrinsics.c: XOP for MD5/MD4/SHA-1 (Solar)
* Add keepass2john utlity for processing input KeePass 2.x database files into
a format suitable for use with JtR. KeePass format is in works. (Dhiru)
* Fix for -subformat=list. The config file was not yet read so we could not get
info for user formats. (magnum)
* john-1.7.9-dynamic-unameonly-1.diff (JimF)
* rar2john: Handle Unicode file names. Less output unless -DDEBUG. (magnum)
* rar2john: fix failure for RAR files with comment present. (Dhiru)
* loader.c: Read gecos and homedir from pwdump-style input. (magnum)
* options.c: Sort formats list (magnum)
* CUDA support added (Lukas)
* Dynamic: Support null bytes in constants. (JimF)
* Keyboard external mode fix (from CVS) (solar)
* All hmac-SHA formats: fix for salt containing '#' and self-tests for keys
larger than pad size (n/a for sha-384/512 as of now due to lack of support from
John itself for lengths gt 125) (magnum)
* All hmac formats: Support key lengths >64 (magnum)
* IPB2: OMP & intrinsics support, over 3x speed (magnum)
* sse2i_winfix.pl modified so it can handle any .S file (magnum)
* Replace the muting of "#!comment" lines when in memory buffer mode (magnum)
* john-1.7.9-jumbo-5-opencl-5-macosx_10.7.diff (minus the c3_fmt stuff)
(András)
* Changed benchmark type to raw for all HMAC formats (magnum)
* HDAA intrinsics, 3x original speed (magnum)
* md5-mmx.S: new interface needed for multi-limb (>55 bytes) crypts (for HDAA)
(magnum)
* Change MPI defaults to be more stable (no MPI_Barrier nor MPI_Abort) (magnum)
* Salted SHA-1: Support any salt size (magnum)
* pass_gen.pl: Add salted sha-1 (of any length up to 16) and fix bugs in base64
encoding (magnum)
* Correct a bug in the "double10" external mode (magnum)
* Adds --max-run-time=N option, for graceful exit after N seconds of cracking.
(magnum)
* OpenCL support added (Lukas, Samuele)
* Jim's new SHA-1 intrinsics. Uses 16x4 buffer instead of 80x4. Improved "make
testpara32" to compare asm figures too. Updated SHA1_SSE_PARA for 16x4 code.
New pre-compiled intrinsics. (magnum)
* Make all sse2i targets use x86-sse.h. Add new test target
linux-x86-64-32-sse2asm. (magnum)
* loader.c: restore the defined-out block for DES bare hashes with whitespace
salt. (magnum)
* loader.c: fix for --user=<uid> when loading pwdump files (magnum)
* MSCHAPv2 salt() alignment (magnum)
* Drop x86-ssei.h in favor of x86-sse.h, add tests that disable intrinsics for
gcc older than 3.4.6 (the oldest we know work at all) and fallback to asm. This
means the sse2/sse2i targets now work similar to 64/64i for newer versions of
gcc, that is, sse2i just means "precompiled intrinsics". (magnum)
* IPB2: fix in binary(), it was reading twice the size of ciphertext and
probably overwriting something. (magnum)
* Deprecated raw-md5 thin (moved to unused) in favour of thick version (magnum)
* Bugfix in trip_fmt.c (from latest CVS version) (solar)
* HDAA: OMP support (magnum)
* sap_prepare.pl renamed to sap2john.pl and changed not to pad salt (magnum)
* ssh2john: Detect if private keyfile has no password (Dhiru)
* RawSHA1: Optimised set_key() for some 17% speedup. (magnum)
* hmac-MD5 optimisations. 32-bit set_key(). (magnum)
* make testpara target, for determining best SSE_PARA values (magnum)
* sapG: Added MMX/SSE/intrinsics. Decreased salt length to 36 (12 x UTF-8)
(changed self-test hash). (magnum)
* Fixed bug in unicode.c where specifically giving --enc=raw did not work as
expected (magnum)
* Added MMX/SSE/intrinsics to sapB as well as lots of optimisation. (magnum)
* john-1.7.9-fastrip-1.diff This patch speeds up DES-based tripcode cracking by
making use of JtR's bitslice DES implementation, including its OpenMP
parallelization. (solar)
* drop cmpt_cp.pl and mkdumb16.pl (will be placed in the separate patch)
(magnum)
* Oracle11: Added intrinsics (magnum)
* mssql05 hash functions size 5 & 6 (magnum)
* MD5_std vs intrinsics / arch.h PARA fixes. Never disable SSE for MD5, revert
to 4x instead. (magnum)
* raw-md5u final fixes (all linux builds pass test suite) (magnum)
* Raw-MD5-unicode made thick again, using much faster code (2x dynamic) (magnum)
* Salted-sha1: performance tweaks (magnum)
* Dynamic md4 final fixes (JimF)
* Dynamic MD5_X2 md4 fixes (JimF)
* Bug fixes to lotus5 (OMP builds) and both mssql formats (MMX builds) (magnum)
* mysqlSHA1 32-bit set_key() for SSE2 (magnum)
* Simplification of differences between SSE2 and SSE2i code.  In nsldap, there
were problems with 32 bit SSE2. (JimF)
* Lotus5: Use the passed in format pointer, and avoid having to forward declare
the static global. Has added benefit of always appearing the same way in all
init() functions of all formats, no name differences. (JimF)
* Cygwin OMP builds were not building x86-sse.o properly, without this change.
(JimF)
* pass_gen.pl added to run/ directory. This has only been available in separate
patches (like the test suite creation scripts) until now, and that version was
not up to date. This is a gem for testing stuff. (magnum)
* XSHA: Added support for OMP and/or intrinsics (magnum)
* Reduced verbosity for normal test targets and added verbose ones (magnum)
* External filter now truncates at format's max length. Turn off wordlist
memory buffer if an external filter is used (a modification would trash the
buffer if a word got longer) (magnum)
* Correct truncation for NT formats. This time with no performance loss (magnum)
* Added copyright statement. (bartavelle)
* Changes Makefile test targets for Test Suite 1.10 (magnum)
* Update src/hmacMD5_fmt_plug.c (JimF)
* dynamic non contiguious number issues BE (JimF)
* Update src/dynamic_utils.c (JimF)
