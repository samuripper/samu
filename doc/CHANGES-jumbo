(SAYANTAN DATTA)
* Added WPAPSK format for CUDA and OpenCL (Lukas Odzioba)
* Make hmacMD5 a non-plugin in order to force it to load after mscash2. Now 
only hmacSHA1 was a plugin of all hmac's so I threw it in as well. (magnum)

* Ignoring build-generated files (bartavelle)
* Mscash and mscash2 formats prepare() fixes (jfoug)

* RAR format: OpenCL support added (in the same one format). Support for AES-NI 
instructions by using OpenSSL EVP instead of low-level calls. Experimental 
support for reverting to CPU in Single mode (when doing a lot fewer than max 
keys per crypt in a batch). Currently #defined out. Added inline storing of RAR 
data in input file when files are small enough. Added lots of self-tests. 
Default to use same length tests as cRARk. Changed format tag from $rar3$ to 
$RAR3$ to enforce re-running rar2john. Moved slow code from set_salt() to 
get_salt() and keep all allocations during the whole run. (magnum)

affect performance. (magnum)
* Implement support for having test vectors and benchmarking in Mozilla format. 
(dsk)
* Remove requirement of cert8.db files for "no master password" check in 
mozilla2john. Remove "no master password" check from mozilla_fmt. (dsk)
* Signed-off-by: myrice <myrice@myrice-laptop.(none)> (myrice)
* Mozilla_fmt bugfix: globalSalt array was smaller than needed, causing 
segfaults. This should be forwarded to the FireMasterLinux project. (magnum)
* mozilla2john: Error (and usage) to stderr Makefile: revert OMPFLAGS (please 
stop committing that!) (magnum)
* OMP support for mozilla format. ~1.5x faster using 3 cores. (dsk)

key buffer instead of just 64. (magnum)
* Use BSD version of tcphdr (patch by Erik). (dsk)
* Fix for OpenCL/CUDA targets w/ pre-built intrinsics (magnum)
* Add make target for vncpcap2john.cpp (dsk)
* Improved vncpcap2john. Works for RFB 3.7 and 3.8 protocol versions. Works 
with TightVNC and RealVNC servers. 3.3 RFB support is TODO. (dsk)

* Improvement: get the LWS and KPC from john's config file. Improvement: check 
if group size is valid. Cosmetic: changes in benchmark comment. See commit: 
9d3fe1414e. Performance: put all working variables in __local memory address 
space. Fixed: allow temp buffer to use all the available local memory. Fixed: 
use small KPC values when running on CPU. On real cracking tasks, big values

(magnum)
* Fix for gpu builds imlicitly using pre-built icc intrinsics (magnum)
* rar_fmt: 15% speedup if ARCH_LITTLE_ENDIAN && ARCH_ALLOWS_UNALIGNED. This 
version can successfully crack non-hp archives with method "store" ("m0b") 
without spawning unrar. Also fixed a bad memory leak. rar2john: Pick best 
candidate from RAR file. Prefer stored files over compressed, and prefer 
smaller files over larger. (magnum)

and rawSHA1_opencl_fmt.c to opencl_rawsha1_fmt.c (Samuele)
* wordlist.c MPI fix for dupe suppression in non-buffered mode. We must 
incrementent the line counter when skipping, because the different nodes will 
have different views of what is a dupe. (magnum)
* sapB bugfix for generic builds (magnum)
* Replace the muting of "#!comment" lines when in memory buffer mode (magnum)
* Wordlist mode: Fix dupe suppression for non-buffered mode. Make the pot file

* john-1.7.9-jumbo-5-opencl-5.diff (Lukas)
* Jim's new SHA-1 intrinsics. Uses 16x4 buffer instead of 80x4. Improved "make

New pre-compiled intrinsics. (magnum)
* sapG fix for long candidates (over 64 octets) (magnum)
* Make all sse2i targets use x86-sse.h. Add new test target 
linux-x86-64-32-sse2asm. (magnum)

structs) (magnum)
* MSCHAPv2 salt() alignment (magnum)
* Drop x86-ssei.h in favor of x86-sse.h, add tests that disable intrinsics for 
gcc older than 3.4.6 (the oldest we know work at all) and fallback to asm. This 
means the sse2/sse2i targets now work similar to 64/64i for newer versions of 
gcc, that is, sse2i just means "precompiled intrinsics". (magnum)
* SHA-crypt-256/512: Change benchmark to only output raw figure since there is 
no difference between one/many salts. Also output "rounds=5000". (magnum)
* Change #include "omp.h" to #include <omp.h> in a number of formats. (magnum)

* Crypt-SHA2 formats using OpenSSL and with OMP support (magnum)
* DragonFly, cosmetic (magnum)
* OMP support for raw-sha2 and DragonFly sha2 formats (magnum)

the bugs in them. (magnum)
* ssha opencl kernel update (Samuele)
* Bugfix in trip_fmt.c (from latest CVS version) (solar)
* sapB & sapG: trim trailing spaces from (truncated) plaintext. Raise sapG 
plaintext length (for UTF-8 encodings of long passwords) Warn if 
--encoding=utf8 is used/not used depending on format: these formats are well 
defined in that aspect. (magnum)
* sapB & sapG minor optimisations (magnum)
* HDAA: get rid of a compiler warning (magnum)
* sapB: key cleaning bugfix. This was a mean one. Weird algo. (magnum)

bug in "magic array" enumeration. (magnum)
* HDAA: OMP support (magnum)
* sapG: Optimisations, 30% boost (now 2x compared to Jumbo-5) (magnum)
* sapG: Various bugfixes. New cleaning mechanism. Seems to work fine now. 
Intermediate key will never be longer than 192 bytes, decreased max number of 
limbs to three. Dropped the internal UTF-8 conversion. It was never 
appropriate. sapG now behaves like any other 8-bit format. If you want UTF-8, 
feed UTF-8. (magnum)
* sapB: Various bugfixes. Use enc_strupper() for proper uc of UTF-8, but init 
the Unicode system in a way so it does not uppercase double-s (magnum)
* sap_prepare.pl renamed to sap2john.pl and changed not to pad salt (magnum)
* sapG minor fix in get_salt() (only affected over-long salts) (magnum)
* sapB bugfix for 8-bit salts (magnum)

* testpara: decrease threshold for accepting a higher value from 5% to 1%. 
(magnum)
* PARA tweaks from Solar's tests (magnum)
* RawSHA1: Optimised set_key() for some 17% speedup. (magnum)
* hmac-MD5 optimisations. 32-bit set_key(). (magnum)
* john-1.7.9-jumbo-5-opencl-3.diff (Samuele)
* make testpara target, for determining best SSE_PARA values (magnum)
* sapB and sapG: re-worked valid() for variable salt length. We still support 
the old format (padded with spaces to 40 characters) but also non-padded. 
(magnum)
* sapG: Added MMX/SSE/intrinsics. Decreased salt length to 36 (12 x UTF-8) 
(changed self-test hash). (magnum)
* sapB: Various fixes. Max salt length 12 (changed self-test hash). Changed 
cur_salt to struct pointer. Non-SSE builds fixes. Replace 8-bit characters with 
'^'. (magnum)
* Fixed bug in unicode.c where specifically giving --enc=raw did not work as 
expected (magnum)
* Added MMX/SSE/intrinsics to sapB as well as lots of optimisation. (magnum)
* Adapt trip_fmt to Jumbo (magnum)
* john-1.7.9-fastrip-1.diff This patch speeds up DES-based tripcode cracking by 
making use of JtR's bitslice DES implementation, including its OpenMP 
parallelization. (solar)
* corrected a typo in the PARA gcc version tests (magnum)
* drop cmpt_cp.pl and mkdumb16.pl (will be placed in the separate patch) 
(magnum)
* Oracle11 optimisations (magnum)
* Oracle11: Added intrinsics (magnum)
* mssql05 hash functions size 5 & 6 (magnum)

to 4x instead. (magnum)
* raw-md5u final fixes (all linux builds pass test suite) (magnum)
* Raw-MD5-unicode made thick again, using much faster code (2x dynamic) (magnum)
* Salted-sha1: performance tweaks (magnum)
* Dynamic md4 final fixes (jfoug)
* Dynamic MD5_X2 md4 fixes (jfoug)

* mysqlSHA1 32-bit set_key() for SSE2 (magnum)
* XSHA: More optimised salt handling, better OMP scaling (magnum)
* Simplification of differences between SSE2 and SSE2i code.  In nsldap, there 
were problems with 32 bit SSE2. (JimF)
* Lotus5: Use the passed in format pointer, and avoid having to forward declare 
the static global. Has added benefit of always appearing the same way in all 
init() functions of all formats, no name differences. (JimF)
* Cygwin OMP builds were not building x86-sse.o properly, without this change. 
(JimF)
* Added MD4 to dynamic. 7 crypt functions were deprecated. These 7 'crypt' 
functions were replaced with 'crypt_md5' functions. 4 new md4 crypt functions 
added. Updated the dynamic conf file, and the dynamic documentation. Added 5 
new builtin types to dynamic (using md4). (JimF)
* pass_gen.pl added to run/ directory. This has only been available in separate 
patches (like the test suite creation scripts) until now, and that version was 
not up to date. This is a gem for testing stuff. (magnum)
* XSHA: Added support for OMP with intrinsics (magnum)
* XSHA: added "option" to revert to OpenSSL for OMP builds. Also fixes 32-bit 
MMX builds. (magnum)
* XSHA intrinsics. Does not support OMP. (magnum)
* Replace length checks in nt2 too. Strangely enough it is faster with them. 
(magnum)
* Reduced verbosity for normal test targets and added verbose ones (magnum)
* External filter now truncates at format's max length. Turn off wordlist 
memory buffer if an external filter is used (a modification would trash the 
buffer if a word got longer) (magnum)
* Correct truncation for NT format. This time with no performance loss (magnum)
* Added copyright statement. (bartavelle)
* Copyright headers for md[45]-mmx.S (bartavelle)
* Changes Makefile test targets for Test Suite 1.10 (magnum)
* This patch reverts part of the NT format to using an incorrect and no longer 
needed length check. That beats me, but it will do until the reason is figured 
out. (magnum)
* Update src/hmacMD5_fmt_plug.c (jfoug)
* Update src/dynamic_utils.c (jfoug)
* dynamic non contiguious number issues BE (JimF)
* Update src/dynamic_utils.c (jfoug)
